## Mods installer from mod.io to SnowRunner

The installer allows you to download mods from mod.io in semi-automatic mode. Once you complete all the steps according to the instructions, you will be able to subscribe to the desired mods, then the installer will download them itself.

Tested on game builds from Steam. Epic Games Store is not tested, you may create a pull request adding the support for it if you want.

### How to use:

1. Download/clone the repository on your computer.
2. Register for an account on [mod.io](https://mod.io/).
3. Go to [/me/access](https://mod.io/me/access).
4. Click on accept API access terms (idr if this is necessary for getting o-auth token but eh do it anyways).
5. Below that there will be a OAuth2 section, give a name for a client (can be anything) and click on create client.
6. Then in the token field, write a new name and generate a token.
7. Copy the token and paste it in the `env.ps1` file in the `ACCESS_TOKEN` variable within the quotes, remember that it is only shown once so make sure to save it somewhere.
8. Open the `env.ps1` file and change the `MODS_DIR` and `USER_PROFILE` variables to the correct paths.
   - MODS_DIR: `C:/Users/USER_NAME/Documents/My Games/SnowRunner/base/Mods/.modio/mods`
   - USER_PROFILE: `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/userdata/USER_ID/1465360/remote/user_profile.cfg`
9. Replace the `user_profile.cfg` file in the `USER_PROFILE` path with the one provided in the repository.
10. Before you run the script for the first time, you need to clear out the mods you may have installed from other sources/methods (if you have any). To do this, go to the `MODS_DIR` path and delete all the folders and files in the `mods` folder. If there are any mods in the mods folder with the same id as the mods you are going to download, the installer will not download them thinking that they are already there and this may not work correctly.
11. Subscribe to the mods you want on mod.io.
12. Run the `ModIO_SR.ps1` file (you can run it by right clicking and selecting run with powershell) and wait until all the mods you subscribed to are downloaded.
13. Start the game and wait a few seconds for the game to load all the mods you have downloaded, or go to "LOAD GAME" and exit back to the main menu to activate the "MOD BROWSER" item.
14. Go to "MOD BROWSER" and enable the necessary mods. The vehicles will become available in the store, the custom maps will become available in "Custom scenarios".

After you subscribe to a new mod or unsubscribe from an existing one, run the installer again to download the new mods or remove the old ones. When unsubscribing, the script will not remove the files from the disk but move them to the cache folder. If you subscribe to the mod again, then after running the installer the mod will not be downloaded again, but will be moved from the cache folder to the mods folder, after that you will need to manually turn it on again in the game in "MOD BROWSER".

The installer will not remove the mods from the cache folder, so if you need to remove them, you will need to do it with the argument given below.

### Arguments:

If you need to remove all mods from the cache, run the installer with `--clear-cache` or `-c` argument.

If you need to download new versions of mods, run the installer with `--update` or `-u` argument (without this argument, only a message about new versions of mods will appear).
### Linux / macOS / Lutris (Python version)

`modio_sr.py` is a port of the PowerShell script that runs anywhere Python 3.8+ is
installed (no extra packages). It does the same job with the same arguments, plus a
few conveniences:

- Reads its config from a `.env` file (gitignored) instead of `env.ps1`.
- Patches your existing `user_profile.cfg` in place (`areModsPermitted`,
  `modDependencies`, `modFilter`, `modTags`) instead of requiring you to replace it,
  so GDPR/ESRB acceptance flags are kept.
- Follows API pagination, so more than 100 subscriptions work.
- Rewrites thumbnail paths to `C:/...` when the mods folder lives inside a Wine prefix.

Setup:

1. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `USER_PROFILE`, `MODS_DIR`.
   For a non-Steam build under Lutris the profile is usually at
   `<prefix>/drive_c/users/Public/Documents/Steam/<EMU>/1465360/remote/user_profile.cfg`
   and the mods dir at
   `<prefix>/drive_c/users/<USER>/Documents/My Games/SnowRunner/base/Mods/.modio/mods`.
2. With the game closed, run `python3 modio_sr.py --init-profile` once to enable mods
   in the profile (no token needed for this step).
3. Subscribe to mods on mod.io, then run `python3 modio_sr.py`.
4. Start the game, wait on the main menu (or Load Game and back), open MOD BROWSER
   and enable the mods.

Arguments are the same as the PowerShell version: `-u/--update`, `-c/--clear-cache`,
`-d/--debug`, `-v/--version`, plus `--init-profile` described above.
